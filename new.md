# Data Analytics
## What problems does Data Analytics solve?
### Exercise
0. Partner up
1. What comes to mind when you think of data analytics? Is there someone at your company that handles analytics? What do they do? Any examples?
2. Share our best findings with the class.
3. Conclude on what problems analytics solves.
4. Share examples of analytics at work.

## What is Data?
### Exercise
Suppose you are the very first product analyst at Uber.

0. Partner up
1. When a user is signing up, what info about that user should you collect?
2. What user actions do you want to keep track of? What pieces of info are necessary?

## What are Databases?
Let's take the raw pieces of data from the previous section and structure them.

## What is Analysis?
- [Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xB5KMLhb0ETkowUzBV6EQho9DVpzP-o0By1q1kkBnN4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Documentation](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Medicare-Physician-and-Other-Supplier-PUF-Methodology.pdf)
- [News](http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/cms-releases-new-physician-hospital-payment-data/2015-06-01)
- [Fact Sheet](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-06-01.html)

### Questions
Together with a partner, answer the following:

- What is this data about? What do the columns mean?
- What types of data are being collected?
- What insights could we extract from this data?
- If you were an insurance company, what are some questions you might have?
- If you were a hospital, what are some questions you might have?
- If you were a physician, what are some questions you might have?
- If you were an analyst, what are some questions/concerns you might have about the data (if any)?

### Question
How is analysis different from analytics?

## What skills/tools are needed?
### Workflow
- [Health grade analysis case study](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-data-made-me-a-believer-in-new-york-citys-restaurant-grades/)
- [Health inspection data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59)
- [Restaurant health ratings visualization](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/dining/new-york-health-department-restaurant-ratings-map.html?_r=1&)

#### Questions
- What is the problem that the author is tackling?
- What was the author's analysis workflow?
- What methods/tools were used?

### Visualization
- [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) | [examples](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
- [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
- [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/)
- [tableau](http://www.tableau.com/)

### Skills
- Excel
- SQL
- Visualization
- Python (optional but recommended)

### Third-Party Tools
- [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/standard/)
- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/engagement/)

# Data Science
## What problems does Data Science solve? What is Big Data?

### Exercise
Read [Netflix & House of Cards](http://www.salon.com/2013/02/01/how_netflix_is_turning_viewers_into_puppets/) and discuss as a group.

#### Questions
- What are some takeaways you found interesting?
- What kind of data is Netflix collecting?
- What other insights/questions would you ask of the data?
- What is big data?

### Examples of data science

## What is Machine Learning?
- What is unsupervised learning?
- What is supervised learning?
- Examples of each

### Terminology
- features
- classification
- regression

### Exercise: Designing a Netflix
- what are some features?
- how would the algorithm get feedback?
- how would the algorithm update based on feedback?

## What skills/tools are needed?
- python, pandas, and sklearn
- SQL and noSQL databases
- statistics, calculus and linear algebra
- R (optional)
- visualization
